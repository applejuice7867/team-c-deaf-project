How this works:
1. server.js
unfinished backend stuff, I didn't make it, someone please finish it.
2. public
frontend
(all the ui and server interaction)
currently the api directly communicates with the client, meaning you either need to local host it or use an exstention, someone please move api interaction to backend
3. script.js
This is where most if not all of the js is.
4. style.css
Please use #8a2be2 for dark mode. Use #ff8d21 for light mode.
Finally, I suck at web stuff and didn't I write a lot of code in this project, so some of what I say might not be accurate, especially regarding the APIs.
